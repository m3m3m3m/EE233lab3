To test the microphone, we built the circuit of the left part of figure[\ref{fig:clip}], from \textit{Microphone} block to $V_3$, and a speaker is connect to the $V_3$ port to make the signal audible. We played music by our cell-phone's speaker, and moved it close to the microphone. Then we could hear the sound from the speaker connected to $V_3$, which was louder than the original audio played by the cellphone.
