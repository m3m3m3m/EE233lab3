In this lab, we learned how to create and interpret Bode plots for various op-amp circuit topographies, through mathematical analysis, SPICE simulation, and most importantly in this report, hardware implementation and measurements. The frequency responses of the system indicate whether the system functions as a low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter. \newline
\phantom{ } We also learned how to use microphone in this lab, and built a mixer with a microphone, a preamplifier and a summing amplifier.
