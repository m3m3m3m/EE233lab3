\textbf{New elements in this lab} \newline
\phantom{ } In this lab, we will use a new element - microphone. It has two pins and one of the pin is connected to its metal shell. We can distinguish one pin from another according to this connection. The pin that is connected to the shell needs to be connected to the ground in the circuit, and the other pin is considered as the high input pin.
