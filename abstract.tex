in this lab report, the frequency responses of the preamplifier and summing amplifier is discussed, and Bode plots are drawn accordingly to show the systems' characteristic. After that, microphone is introduced so that the mixer circuit was built based on the summing amplifier with a channel replaced by a microphone and a preamplifier.
