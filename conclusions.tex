According to the Bode plots, we can conclude that the summing amplifier and preamplifier works well with low frequency input. We also found out that the distortion causing by increasing $R_f$ in summing amplifier is related to the $V_{CC}$ and $V_{EE}$ of the amplifier. The capacitor in the summing amplifier has a function as a high pass filter, as our measurements and analysis showed. \newline
\phantom{ } We successfully build the mixer with one channel microphone input and the others two regular audio inputs, based on the previous test result. The mixer mixed the audio signals as we expected.
